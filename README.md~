# Recommendation system using Item-based collaborative filtering
## Dataset used: MovieLens

##Task 1:
## Model-based CF Algorithm:
Predict absent ratings for testing dataset.
A Model-based CF recommendation system by using Spark MLlib.
Model Used: ALS algorithm
Accuracy obtained: RMSE = 1.0006

##Task 2:
## Item-based collaborative filtering using Pearson correlation:
Predict absent ratings for testing dataset.
Accuracy obtained: RMSE = 0.9742

##Questions:
* How have you handled the missing users, outlier rating when predicted value exceeds [0,5] range?
The normal algorithms do not take into account the missing users/movies in the testing data set. For that I did the “Simple Mean
Imputation”.
    1) That means that for the movies which are not present in the training data, I just took the mean of all the ratings given by the respective user as the rating of the item.
    2) If the user is not present then it gives the average rating of the movie to it.
    3) If both the user and the movie are not present in the training data set, then I have set the prediction as 2.5

To handle the outlier ratings, if the rating goes above 5 or below 0, then I am taking the average of the movie and assigning it as the
rating.

* How to run your program for both tasks?
**Task 1:**
1) spark-submit --class "Himanshu_Purandare_Task1" --master local[*] Himanshu_Purandare_task1.jar "<Path_to_Ratings.csv>"
"*<path_to_testing_small.csv>*"
**Task 2:**
1) spark-submit --class "Himanshu_Purandare_Task2" --master local[*] Himanshu_Purandare_task2.jar "*<Path_to_Ratings.csv>*"
"*<Path_to_Testing_small.csv>*"

* Any improvement in your recommendation system?
I have taken neighbourhood as 20 to get better results.
Also, I have used Case Amplification for getting better results. By doing Case amplification, we can reduce noise and thus get better results.
Case Amplification favours high weights while penalises smaller weights. Thus, this changes the neighbourhood of the predictions.
